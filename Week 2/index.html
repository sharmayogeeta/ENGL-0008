            <h2>What is Compare and Contrast Writing?</h2>
            <p><strong>Compare:</strong> To examine similarities between two or more things<br>
            <strong>Contrast:</strong> To examine differences between two or more things</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Why Is This Important?</h4>
                <p>Compare and contrast writing helps you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analyze information critically</li>

                <div class="assignment-card">
                    <h4>Purpose 1: To Inform</h4>
                    <p>Present neutral information about similarities and differences without taking sides.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Both online and traditional education have unique characteristics that students should consider."</p>

            <h2>Step 2: Selecting Comparison Criteria</h2>
            <p><strong>Criteria</strong> are the specific points you'll use to compare your subjects. Good criteria are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Important to your purpose</li>
                <li><strong>Parallel:</strong> Can be applied to both subjects</li>
                <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Clear and measurable</li>
                <li><strong>Limited:</strong> Usually 2-4 main points for clarity</li>

                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Comparing purchasing (process) with storage (physical space) - these don't match!</p>

            <h1>Grammar Focus: Understanding Sentence Errors</h1>
            
            <h2>What Are Run-on Sentences?</h2>
            <p>A run-on sentence occurs when two or more complete sentences are joined together without proper punctuation or connecting words.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>What Makes a Complete Sentence?</h4>
                <p>A complete sentence must have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Subject:</strong> Who or what the sentence is about</li>
                    <li><strong>Predicate:</strong> What the subject does or is</li>
                    <li><strong>Complete thought:</strong> Makes sense by itself</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Types of Run-on Sentences</h2>
            
            <h3>Type 1: Fused Sentences (No Punctuation)</h3>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Incorrect Examples</h4>
                <p>"I love reading books they help me relax after work."</p>
                <p>"The weather is beautiful today I want to go for a walk."</p>
                <p>"She studied hard for the exam she passed with excellent grades."</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Type 2: Comma Splices (Comma Only)</h3>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Incorrect Examples</h4>
                <p>"I love reading books, they help me relax after work."</p>
                <p>"The weather is beautiful today, I want to go for a walk."</p>
                <p>"She studied hard for the exam, she passed with excellent grades."</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Why These Errors Happen</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thinking too fast:</strong> Your brain moves faster than your writing</li>
                <li><strong>Related ideas:</strong> The sentences seem connected, so you join them incorrectly</li>
                <li><strong>Speaking patterns:</strong> In speech, we often pause briefly between related thoughts</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of awareness:</strong> Not recognizing where one complete thought ends</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Quick Test: Is It a Run-on?</h4>
                <p>Read your sentence aloud and ask:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Can I break this into two complete sentences?</li>
                    <li>Does each part have its own subject and verb?</li>
                    <li>Does each part express a complete thought?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If you answered "yes" to all three, and they're joined incorrectly, you have a run-on!</p>

            <h1>Grammar Focus: Fixing Sentence Errors</h1>
            
            <h2>Method 1: Separate with a Period</h2>
            <p>The simplest solution: Make two separate sentences.</p>
            
            <div class="success-box">
                <h4>Examples Fixed with Periods</h4>
                <p><strong>Before:</strong> "I love reading books they help me relax after work."<br>
                <strong>After:</strong> "I love reading books. They help me relax after work."</p>
                
                <p><strong>Before:</strong> "The weather is beautiful today, I want to go for a walk."<br>
                <strong>After:</strong> "The weather is beautiful today. I want to go for a walk."</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Method 2: Use Coordinating Conjunctions</h2>
            <p>Connect sentences with FANBOYS: <strong>F</strong>or, <strong>A</strong>nd, <strong>N</strong>or, <strong>B</strong>ut, <strong>O</strong>r, <strong>Y</strong>et, <strong>S</strong>o</p>
            
            <div class="success-box">

                <strong>After:</strong> "I love reading books, <span style="color: #e53e3e; font-weight: bold;">and</span> they help me relax after work."</p>

            </div>
            
            <h2>Method 3: Use Subordinating Conjunctions</h2>
            <p>Make one sentence dependent on the other using words like: because, although, since, when, while, if, unless</p>
            
            <div class="success-box">
                <h4>Examples Fixed with Subordinating Conjunctions</h4>

            </div>
            
            <h2>Method 4: Use Semicolons (Advanced)</h2>
            <p>Use semicolons to connect closely related sentences.</p>
            
            <div class="success-box">
                <h4>Examples Fixed with Semicolons</h4>
                <p><strong>Before:</strong> "She studied hard for the exam she passed with excellent grades."<br>
                <strong>After:</strong> "She studied hard for the exam<span style="color: #e53e3e; font-weight: bold;">;</span> she passed with excellent grades."</p>

            <h2>Good vs. Poor Feedback Examples</h2>
            
            <h3>Example Assignment Excerpt:</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p>"Living in a big city is better than living in a small town. Cities have more job opportunities. There are also more restaurants and entertainment. Small towns are boring and don't have much to do."</p>

            <h3>Poor Feedback Example:</h3>
            <div class="feedback-bad">
                <h4>What NOT to do:</h4>
                <p>"Good job. I agree with your points. Maybe add more details. Some grammar errors need fixing."</p>
                <p><strong>Problems:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Too vague - no specific examples</li>
                    <li>Doesn't identify which grammar errors</li>
                    <li>No specific suggestions for improvement</li>
                    <li>Doesn't address assignment requirements</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Excellent Feedback Example:</h3>
            <div class="feedback-example">
                <h4>What TO do:</h4>
                <p>"Your topic sentence clearly states your preference for city living, which directly answers the assignment prompt. Your supporting points about job opportunities and entertainment are relevant and easy to understand.</p>
                
                <p>To strengthen your paragraph, consider adding specific examples. For instance, instead of saying 'more job opportunities,' you could mention 'diverse career options in finance, technology, and healthcare.' This would make your argument more convincing.</p>
                
                <p>The sentence 'Small towns are boring and don't have much to do' sounds harsh and might offend readers from small towns. Consider rephrasing this more neutrally, such as 'Small towns typically offer fewer entertainment options.'</p>
                
                <p>Your paragraph structure follows the assignment requirements well with a clear topic sentence and supporting details. Adding a concluding sentence would help wrap up your ideas effectively."</p>

                <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Captures both sides of the author's argument and mentions the key concern about groupthink.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Avoid:</strong> "The author talks about technology and social media."</p>

However, I also believe technology has given us access to more diverse viewpoints than previous generations had."</p>
                
                <p><strong>Disagreement:</strong> "While I understand the author's concerns, I disagree that technology necessarily creates groupthink. In my experience, social media has actually exposed me to many different cultures and ideas that I wouldn't have encountered otherwise. The key is learning to seek out diverse sources rather than staying in one's comfort zone."</p>

                    <p><strong>Focus on similarities:</strong> "Despite their different sizes, both Prague and Vienna share similar European charm through their historic architecture, café culture, and public transportation systems."</p>

                    <h4>Example Supporting Details</h4>
                    <p><strong>Point 1 - Pace of life:</strong> "Salem moves at a relaxed, small-town pace where people often stop to chat with neighbors on the street. In contrast, Boston's fast-paced environment keeps people focused on their destinations with little time for casual conversation."</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Point 2 - Transportation:</strong> "While Salem residents rely primarily on cars for transportation, Boston offers extensive public transit including subways, buses, and commuter trains that make car ownership optional."</p>

                    <p><strong>Express preference:</strong> "While I appreciate Boston's opportunities and energy, Salem's sense of community and slower pace make it a more appealing place to call home."</p>

            <div class="step-by-step">
                <h4>Step 1: Review Your Work</h4>
                <p>Before writing, look back at:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your assignments from Units 1 and 2</li>
                    <li>Feedback you received from peers and instructor</li>

            </div>
            
            <div class="step-by-step">
                <h4>Step 2: Be Specific and Honest</h4>
                <p>Don't just say "everything was good" or "it was hard." Instead:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Name specific strategies that helped you</li>
                    <li>Identify particular assignments or concepts</li>
                    <li>Explain your reasoning with examples</li>
                    <li>Be honest about your struggles and successes</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Sample Journal Entry</h4>
                <p>"The pre-reading strategies from Unit 1, especially previewing headings and predicting content, really helped me understand 'The Technological Age' article more effectively. I found the oral presentation assignment in Unit 1 challenging because I was nervous about recording myself speaking, but it helped me practice pronunciation and organization. The most difficult part of this unit has been identifying run-on sentences in my own writing - I can spot them in other people's work but miss them in mine. The paragraph structure lessons have been the most helpful because they give me a clear framework to follow. I'm wondering if there are any additional resources for grammar practice, especially with tenses, because I still sometimes confuse past simple and present perfect."</p>
                
                <p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Specific about which strategies helped</li>
                    <li>Honest about challenges and reasons</li>
                    <li>Identifies particular areas of difficulty</li>
                    <li>Asks a specific question for support</li>
                    <li>Shows reflection and self-awareness</li>
