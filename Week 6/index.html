            <p>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is a Nigerian author who shares her personal experiences with stereotypes and the dangers of having only one perspective about people, places, or cultures.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Concept: What Is a "Single Story"?</h3>
            <div class="example-box">
                <p>A <strong>"single story"</strong> is when we know only one narrative about a person, place, or culture. This incomplete picture creates stereotypes and prevents us from seeing the full, complex reality.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you only watch news about negative events in a country, you might think that's all there is to that place, missing the beautiful culture, happy people, and positive developments.</p>

            <h1>🌍 Key Themes in "The Danger of a Single Story"</h1>
            
            <h3>1. Early Influences Shape Our Perceptions</h3>
            <p>Adichie explains how reading only British and American books as a child made her believe all books had to be about foreign experiences, not her own Nigerian life.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Single Stories Create Stereotypes</h3>
            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Adichie's Example:</strong> She only knew that her house boy Fide's family was poor. When she visited them and saw a beautiful basket they made, she was surprised because she couldn't see them as anything but poor.</p>

        <!-- Slide 11: Grammar - Comma Usage Introduction -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>✍️ Grammar: Using Commas Effectively</h1>
            <h2>Why Are Commas Important?</h2>
            
            <p>Commas are like traffic signals in your sentences - they tell readers when to pause and help group ideas together. Without commas, sentences can be confusing!</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <h3>See the Difference:</h3>
                <p><strong>Without comma:</strong> "Let's eat Grandma!"</p>
                <p><strong>With comma:</strong> "Let's eat, Grandma!"</p>
                <p>The comma saves Grandma from being eaten! 😊</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>What Commas Do:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Signal pauses in sentences</li>
                <li>Show how ideas are grouped</li>
                <li>Separate parts that would otherwise run together</li>
                <li>Make writing clearer and easier to read</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 12: Comma Rule 1 -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Comma Rule #1: After Introductory Ideas</h1>
            <h2>Use a comma after introductory words, phrases, or clauses</h2>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <h3>Examples:</h3>
                <p>✅ <strong>Whenever I eat pasta,</strong> I think of my vacation in Rome.</p>
                <p>✅ <strong>If you ever need help with an assignment,</strong> email the instructor.</p>
                <p>✅ <strong>After the war ended,</strong> the civilians returned home to rebuild their city.</p>
                <p>✅ <strong>Although the economy rebounded after the recession,</strong> many people still suffered from lost wealth.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Why This Works:</h3>
            <p>The comma gives readers a moment to process the introductory information before moving to the main idea of the sentence.</p>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>💡 Test:</strong> If your sentence starts with words like "when," "if," "after," "although," "because," "since," or "while," you probably need a comma after the introductory clause!

        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Comma Rule #2: Separating Descriptive Phrases</h1>
            <h2>Use commas to set off extra information that describes</h2>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <h3>Examples:</h3>
                <p>✅ The old man, <strong>suffering from fatigue and dehydration,</strong> could barely talk.</p>
                <p>✅ Dr. Livingston, <strong>professor of history at the university,</strong> lectured on the challenges facing the 21st century.</p>
                <p>✅ My grandmother, <strong>who is one of the kindest people I've ever met,</strong> would often send bags of food home with the children.</p>
                <p>✅ The child was afraid of large animals, <strong>such as bears and tigers.</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Test:</h3>
            <p>If you can remove the information between the commas and the sentence still makes sense, you've used commas correctly!</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Dr. Livingston lectured on the challenges facing the 21st century." - Still makes sense! ✅</p>

            <h1>Comma Rule #3: Joining Complete Sentences</h1>

            <h3>Important Rule:</h3>
            <p>Both parts must be complete sentences (have a subject and verb). If the second part is not a complete sentence, DON'T use a comma.</p>

            <h1>🎯 Powerful Editing Strategies</h1>
            
            <h3>1. Read Your Paper Aloud</h3>
            <p>Hearing your words helps you catch awkward phrasing and missing words. Your ears catch things your eyes miss!</p>
            
            <h3>2. Read Backwards</h3>
            <p>Start at the last sentence and read to the first. This forces you to focus on each sentence individually rather than getting caught up in the content.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Print Your Paper</h3>
            <p>Editing on paper can help you see errors you miss on screen. Use a different colored pen to make corrections.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Know Your Patterns</h3>
            <p>Do you always forget commas? Mix up "their/there/they're"? Make a list of YOUR common errors and check specifically for those.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Use a Friend</h3>
            <p>Ask someone else to read your paper and give feedback. Fresh eyes catch new things!</p>

                <p>"Thank you for sharing your experience with single stories about your home country. I found it interesting that you mentioned how TV shows created stereotypes. This connects to my own experience when I moved to a new city - people had a single story about where I came from based on movies they'd seen. How do you think we can challenge these stereotypes when we encounter them in our daily lives? Your point about seeking multiple perspectives really resonated with me."</p>

                <p>"The strategy I found most helpful was reading my paper aloud. In the past, I would just read silently and miss many errors. Reading aloud helps me hear awkward sentences and missing words. The idea of editing in stages is new to me - I usually tried to fix everything at once. I plan to use the checklist to edit my content first, then structure, then grammar. This will help me be more systematic in my editing process."</p>

            <div class="answer-box">
                <p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> A "single story" is when we know only one narrative or perspective about a person, place, or culture. This incomplete picture creates stereotypes and prevents us from seeing the full, complex reality of people and situations.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="answer-box">
                <p><strong>Answer 2:</strong> This needs a comma after an introductory clause. Correct sentence: "After finishing my homework<strong>,</strong> I went to bed." The comma signals a pause after the introductory information.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="answer-box">
                <p><strong>Answer 3:</strong> The first stage is editing for <strong>content</strong> (big picture ideas). You should edit in stages because trying to fix everything at once is overwhelming and causes you to miss errors. Focusing on one aspect at a time (content, then structure, then style, then grammar) is more effective.</p>

                <p><strong>Answer 4:</strong> <strong>FALSE.</strong> You only use a comma before "and," "but," "or," "so" when they join two <strong>complete sentences</strong> (both sides have a subject and verb). If the second part is not a complete sentence, don't use a comma.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

                    <li><strong>Read your paper aloud</strong> - helps catch awkward phrasing</li>
                    <li><strong>Take a break</strong> - gives you fresh eyes</li>
                    <li><strong>Read backwards</strong> - focuses on individual sentences</li>
                    <li><strong>Edit in stages</strong> - content, structure, style, grammar separately</li>
                    <li><strong>Get peer feedback</strong> - fresh perspective catches new things</li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Key Takeaways from Week 6:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ Single stories create stereotypes - seek multiple perspectives</li>
                <li>✅ Commas improve clarity - use them correctly after introductory clauses, around descriptive phrases, before conjunctions in compound sentences, and between items in a series</li>
                <li>✅ Editing is essential - NO ONE writes perfectly the first time</li>
                <li>✅ Edit in stages - content, structure, style, grammar, references</li>
                <li>✅ Take breaks and read aloud - these strategies really work!</li>
            </ul>
